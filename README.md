# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

Project Tic Tac Toe has been set as part of The Odin project. Create a game of tic tac toe whilst ensuring to use as little global code as possible, by tucking everthing away inside of a module or factory. Skills learnt from the prevoiuse lesson Factory Functions & The Module Pattern.

## Objective

1- Create a browser based game of Tic Tac Toe <br>
2- The main goal is to use as little global cosed as possible. Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory. <br>
3- Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s. <br>
4- Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. <br>
5- Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie. <br>
6- Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player! <br>
